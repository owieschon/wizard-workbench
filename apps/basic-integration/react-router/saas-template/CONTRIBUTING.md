## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our code of conduct. Please be
respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps outlined in the main [README.md](./README.md#getting-started).

## Issue Workflow

1. **Create an issue** describing your proposed feature or bug fix. Include:
   - A clear title
   - Description of the problem or feature
   - Relevant context (screenshots, logs, examples)
2. **Get approval** from one of the maintainers (the ReactSquad team) before
   opening a pull request, so you don't waste time on a pull request that won't
   be merged.
3. Once approved, proceed to implement the changes in a new branch.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature/fix branch** off of `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```

2. **Implement your changes**, adhering to the [Style Guide](#style-guide).
3. **Write tests** (see [Testing Guidelines](#testing-guidelines)).
4. **Run checks**:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck    # Type checking
   npm run lint         # Linting
   npm run test         # Unit & integration tests
   npm run test:e2e:ui  # End-to-end tests
   ```

5. **Commit changes** following our [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines).

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clarity
and automated versioning. Commit message format:

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

After staging, use Commitizen for consistent formatting:

```bash
npx cz
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Open a pull request against `reactsquad/main`.
4. **Link the approved issue** in your PR description.
5. Ensure all checks pass and the build is green.
6. Request review from at least one maintainer.
7. Address feedback; maintainers may request commit squashing.

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Location

- **Tests live adjacent to implementation files**, for example:

  ```text
  src/components/Button.tsx
  src/components/Button.test.tsx
  ```

### Coverage Requirements

- **New features** must include tests at the appropriate level: unit,
  integration, component, or E2E.
- **Bug fixes** require a reproducible failing test first. Once the test fails,
  implement the fix so the test passes.

### Test Style

Follow the project’s testing conventions:

- **Prose style**: `given: ... should: ...`
- **Assertions**: `expect(actual).toEqual(expected)`
- See
  [5 Questions Every Test Must Answer](https://medium.com/@ericelliott/5-questions-every-test-must-answer-18a03194eeb1).

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test        # Unit & integration
npm run test:e2e:ui # End-to-end
```

## Style Guide

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode
- Define explicit return types
- Favor `type` for object shapes

### React

- Functional components with hooks
- Follow React Router patterns
- Use React Hook Form for forms
- Implement error boundaries

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui component system
- Maintain dark mode support

### File Structure & Naming

- All files must be named in `kebab-case`.
- All constants must be named in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

### Code Quality

- Biome
- Write self-documenting code
- Add TSDoc to your complex functions
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused (DOT principle)

Thank you for helping improve the React Router SaaS Template! We look forward to
your contributions.
