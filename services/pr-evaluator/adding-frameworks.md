# Adding a new framework to the evaluator

Use this guide after adding framework commandments to Context Mill. The evaluator loads those rules automatically; this repository only needs a change when its detector cannot classify the framework.

## Check framework detection

Open `services/pr-evaluator/prompt-builder.ts` and check `detectFramework()`. If your framework uses common file extensions or dependency files (`.py`, `package.json`, `Gemfile`, etc.), it's likely already detected.

If not, add one detection line:

```typescript
if (/my-framework/.test(depContent) || /my-framework/.test(filePaths)) tags.add("my-framework");
```

Also check `detectArchType()`: is your framework server-only, client-only, or full-stack? Add the tag to the appropriate array if missing.

## Add a test app and run the evaluator

```bash
# Add an example app under apps/{workflow}/{framework}/
# Run the wizard against it to generate a PR branch
# Then evaluate:
pnpm run evaluate -- -b HEAD --test-run my-framework-test
```

## Validate the evaluation

Check the output for false positives:

<!-- sourcebound:allow-inline-document target="test-evaluations/my-framework-test/output.md" reason="The preceding evaluator command creates this per-run output" -->
<!-- sourcebound:allow-inline-document target="test-evaluations/my-framework-test/scores.json" reason="The preceding evaluator command creates this per-run output" -->

- `test-evaluations/my-framework-test/output.md`: check for false positives.
- `test-evaluations/my-framework-test/scores.json`: check that the confidence score matches the evidence.

If false positives exist, the commandments need to be more specific.

## How commandments sync works

The evaluator fetches commandments at startup in this order:

1. Fetches the latest rules from the `PostHog/context-mill` main branch with a 5-second timeout
2. Falls back to `COMMANDMENTS_PATH` env var if set (local context-mill checkout)
3. Falls back to vendored copy at `services/pr-evaluator/prompts/commandments.yaml`
4. Parses the YAML into `tag -> rules[]` map
5. `detectFramework(prData)` matches PR files against known patterns to find tags
6. Matching commandments are injected into the system prompt as authoritative SDK rules

Context Mill changes therefore reach the next evaluator run without a manual sync.
